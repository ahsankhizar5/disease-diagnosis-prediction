# Disease Diagnosis Prediction

A healthcare-focused machine learning project to predict the likelihood of diseases such as **diabetes** or **heart disease** based on medical records. It includes thorough data exploration, multiple model training approaches, and evaluation using F1 scores and AUC-ROC to ensure diagnostic relevance and performance.

📄 Includes a complete **Report.pdf** and explanatory **ProjectVideo.mp4** for academic or professional reference.
